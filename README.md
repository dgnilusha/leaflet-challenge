# Earthquake Mapping challenge

This project displays earthquake data on a map using Leaflet and D3.js. The map shows the locations of earthquakes that occurred within the past week, and each earthquake is represented by a circle with a size based on its magnitude and color based on its depth.

How to Use:

Open index.html in your web browser to view the map.

The map shows the world view with circles indicating earthquake locations.

The circle's size represents the earthquake's magnitude, and the color represents its depth. The legend on the bottom-right of the map explains the color-coding.

Click on a circle to see more information about the earthquake, including its magnitude and location.

Dependencies:

The project uses Leaflet (v1.7.1) for map visualization. The Leaflet CSS and JavaScript files are included in the index.html file.

D3.js is used to fetch GeoJSON data and customize the earthquake markers. The D3.js library is also included in the index.html file.
